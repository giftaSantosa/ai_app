    "# 🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Prediction Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## HR Analytics with MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook builds a machine learning pipeline to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how ML can support data-driven HR and retention decisions using production-ready practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 Key Things Learned\n",
    "Load, explore, and preprocess structured HR data\n",
    "Train and evaluate classification models for attrition prediction\n",
    "Machine Learning Operations to track experiments and models using MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Business Problem\n",
    "Employee attrition is expensive and disruptive.\n",
    "Organizations need early signals to identify employees at risk of leaving so they can take proactive retention actions (e.g., compensation review, workload adjustment, career development).\n",
    "This project predicts attrition risk to support better workforce planning and retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Workflow\n",
    "Data loading & exploration\n",
    "Data preprocessing & feature encoding\n",
    "Baseline model training (Random Forest)\n",
    "Model comparison (Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "Experiment tracking & model registration with MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Key Features\n",
    "MLflow experiment tracking\n",
    "Model comparison and versioning\n",
    "Reproducible, production-ready pipeline\n",
    "Business-focused interpretation of results\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build a practical HR attrition prediction system. 🚀"
